<h2>About Me</h2>
<hr/>
<p>Hello everyone, my name is Naresh Singh Dhami, and I am 29 years old. I am Nepalese by nationality and was born in the far-western region of Nepal. Regarding my education, I completed my school-level studies at Shree Malikarjun Higher Secondary School in Mad, Darchula. After finishing school, I moved to the Kailali district to pursue higher education. I studied for two years at NAST Higher Secondary School and graduated from high school with first division.</p>
<p>After completing my higher education, I moved to Kathmandu, the capital city of Nepal, to pursue an undergraduate degree. I enrolled at Kathmandu University in the Electrical and Electronics Engineering program. However, after completing one semester, my father encouraged me to switch to Civil Engineering, and I made the transition. I completed my bachelor's degree in November 2017 and have since been working in various roles across the civil engineering industry.</p>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy traveling, although I haven't visited many destinations yet (despite having plenty of plans in mind). Besides traveling, I have a passion for learning to code and exploring new advancements in technology, particularly in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Currently, I am simultaneously learning machine learning and a full-stack development course.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for going through my boring stuff.</p>
